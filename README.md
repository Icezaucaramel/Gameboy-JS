# Gameboy-JS

Unfortunately i didn't had time to implement a menu, music or other games yet. But here's a gameboy, simple and with just a snake. 

# Controls
If you want to start the gameboy, click on the button on the upper left of the gameboy, it will display a loading screen then launch the game
 
The controls for the js game are the arrows of the keyboard (↑↓←→) to move the snake and A (or Q for querty keyboards) to respawn
Select, start, and B doesn't do anything for the moment.
(The button B is in the js code because i wanted to add an easter egg)

# To be continued...
Fixing the bugs wasn't the easiest thing, but I was able to fix the most important ones.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have discovered any problems.
I'll continue working on this project after my finals
